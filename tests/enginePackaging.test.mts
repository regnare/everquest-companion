// ============================================================================
// enginePackaging.test.mts — the shipped engine's ADDRESS and its SIGNATURE (JOS-473, phase 3).
// ============================================================================
//
// Two facts live in two files that cannot see each other, and both fail SILENTLY when they drift:
//
//   1. WHERE THE BINARY LANDS. `electron-builder.yml` decides; `engineBinaryCandidates`
//      (src/main/dataServer/engineProtocol.ts) probes. A `to:` renamed on one side produces a
//      packaged app that logs "engine binary not found" and runs on without it — which is the
//      ORDINARY, expected state for every build before this one, so nobody would read it as a
//      regression. This suite composes the config's destination and requires it to BE the
//      resolver's first packaged candidate, rather than restating a string a reader would have to
//      diff by eye.
//
//   2. WHETHER IT IS SIGNED. Ruling 16 (docs/plans/data-server.md): a shipped Rust engine is
//      acceptable and "joins the code-signing set like any shipped executable". Nothing in this
//      repo signs it explicitly — app-builder-lib does, but only under conditions our config has
//      to keep holding. Measured in app-builder-lib 26:
//
//        * `fileMatcher.copyFiles` hands the sign transformer to the DIRECTORY branch only. A
//          matcher whose `from` is a single FILE is copied by `copyOrLinkFile`, which has never
//          heard of signing. That one-word difference between two configs that both "work" is the
//          entire reason this suite exists.
//        * `WinPackager.createTransformerForExtraFiles` returns null wholesale when
//          `signAndEditExecutable` or `signExecutable` is false, and otherwise signs a copied file
//          when `shouldSignFile` says so — `.exe` by default, but `signExts` REPLACES that default
//          and could drop the engine out of the set while the installer still signs.
//        * `windowsSignToolManager.signFile` invokes the custom `sign` hook when one is
//          configured, cert or no cert, which is what makes `scripts/azure-sign.cjs` the single
//          door every signed file in this product goes through.
//
//      So the test asserts the PRECONDITIONS, in the config, with the code path that reads each
//      one named beside it. It cannot prove a signature exists (that needs the AZURE_* secrets and
//      therefore CI), and it does not pretend to: what it prevents is the config quietly ceasing
//      to ask.
